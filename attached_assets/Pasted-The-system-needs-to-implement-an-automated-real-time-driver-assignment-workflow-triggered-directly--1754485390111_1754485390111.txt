The system needs to implement an automated, real-time driver assignment workflow triggered directly by the kitchen staff's actions.

When a Superadmin approves a driver's registration, that driver immediately becomes online and available within a global pool of drivers. This means the system can consider them for any new orders.

Workflow Triggered by Kitchen Staff
When a Kitchen Staff member clicks the "Start Preparing" button for an order on their /kitchen dashboard:

Real-time Driver Notification (Proximity-Based): The system must automatically identify the nearest available driver(s) to the restaurant's location. A real-time notification will then be sent to this driver (or a small group of nearby drivers) via their Driver Bot Mini Web App.

This notification will prompt the driver to accept or reject the order.

Upon acceptance, the order is automatically assigned to that driver. If rejected, the system should attempt to notify the next closest available driver.

Real-time Customer Notification: The Customer Bot (Mini Web App) must receive an immediate notification that their order has begun preparation.

Real-time Tracking for Admins: Both the Restaurant Admin (for orders specific to their restaurant) and the Superadmin (for all orders across the platform) dashboards will update in real-time to reflect the order's "preparing" status and, subsequently, the assigned driver's details and delivery progress.

Driver Visibility and Assignment Logic
Global Driver Pool (System-Managed): All drivers, once approved by a Superadmin and set to "online" status, are part of a central pool from which the system automatically selects the closest available driver for new orders.

Restaurant Admin View: Restaurant Admins will not see a list of all available drivers. Their dashboard will focus on their restaurant's orders and, once a driver is assigned to one of their orders, they will see only the details of that specific assigned driver for tracking purposes. This keeps their interface focused and secure.

Superadmin View: The Superadmin dashboard will maintain its comprehensive overview, displaying all drivers (their status, location if online, and assigned orders) and all orders across the entire platform, providing full operational oversight.

This design ensures that driver assignments are efficient and automatic, while maintaining appropriate data visibility for each user role.

Driver Credit System
This feature allows the Superadmin to manage driver finances by adding or deducting credit, which drivers use to "pay" the platform for orders they accept.

Backend Changes (MongoDB):

Add a new field, creditBalance (as a numerical value), to each document in the drivers collection.

Create a new, secure API endpoint (e.g., /admin/updateDriverCredit) that only Superadmins can access. This endpoint will take a driverId and an amount to update the driver's credit balance.

Front-End Changes (Superadmin Dashboard):

Add a user interface on the driver management page to display each driver's creditBalance.

Include an input field and a button that allows Superadmins to easily add credit to a driver's account.

2. Cash-on-Delivery (COD) with Distance-Based Fee
This feature will give customers a COD payment option and dynamically calculate a delivery fee.

Backend Changes (API Logic):

Add logic to the order processing system to calculate a deliveryFee based on the estimated distance between the restaurant and the customer. Use a service like OpenStreetMap's routing API to get the distance.

Implement a fee structure (e.g., a base fee + a price per kilometer) to calculate the deliveryFee.

Add a paymentMethod field to the order document in MongoDB, which will be set to "Cash on Delivery" if the customer chooses this option.

Add a deliveryFee field to the order document to save the calculated amount.

Front-End Changes (Customer Bot Mini-App):

Display Estimated Fee: When the customer reaches the checkout page, the bot must use the distance between the restaurant and the customer to calculate and display the estimated deliveryFee immediately.

Show Order Breakdown: On the checkout screen, clearly show the order subtotal, the deliveryFee, and the totalAmount the customer will pay in cash.

COD Option: Add a visible option for "Cash on Delivery" that customers can select.

3. Integrating COD with the Driver Credit System
This final step connects the two features to create a complete system.

Backend Changes:

When an order with paymentMethod: 'Cash on Delivery' is completed by a driver, the system must automatically deduct the totalAmount (subtotal + delivery fee) from the driver's creditBalance. The driver effectively pays the platform for the order and keeps the cash.

not show upcoming delivery order on driver mini webapp dashboard and To add a "Special Offers" slider to the customer bot and a dashboard for kitchen staff, the Replit AI agent needs to implement changes across the backend and both front-end applications.

Here is a detailed description of the features and the required modifications.

1. Backend (Database & API)
The agent must create a new system to manage the special offers.

New Database Collection: Create a new MongoDB collection called specialOffers. Each document in this collection will represent a single offer and contain the following fields:

offerId: A unique identifier for the offer.

restaurantId: The ID of the restaurant that created the offer.

offerTitle: A short, descriptive title (e.g., "Burger Combo Deal").

offerImageURL: The URL of the image for the offer.

originalPrice: The original price of the item.

discountedPrice: The special discounted price.

discountPercentage: The percentage off (e.g., "30% OFF").

isLive: A boolean to indicate if the offer is currently active.

New API Endpoints: Create the following API endpoints:

POST /restaurant/offers: This endpoint will allow kitchen staff to upload a new offer, including an image file. The backend will handle the file upload to a persistent storage service and store the image's URL in the database.

GET /customer/offers: This endpoint will retrieve all currently live special offers from all restaurants.

2. Frontend (Kitchen Staff Dashboard)
The kitchen staff dashboard needs a new interface to manage offers.

Offer Management Panel: Add a new section to the dashboard called "Special Offers."

Form: This section should include a form with input fields for offerTitle, originalPrice, discountedPrice, and a file input for the offerImage.

Offer List: Display a list of all existing offers from that restaurant. Each offer should have a toggle or a button to easily set its isLive status, making it simple to activate or deactivate deals.

3. Frontend (Customer Bot Mini-App)
The customer bot needs a new slider to display the offers.

API Integration: The bot will make an API call to the GET /customer/offers endpoint to retrieve all live offers.

UI Component: On the main menu page, add an automatic, horizontally scrolling "Special Offers" slider. The slider should be prominently placed to catch the user's attention.

Offer Card: Each slide will be an "offer card" that displays the offerImageURL, offerTitle, originalPrice (with a strikethrough), the discountedPrice, and the discountPercentage (e.g., "30% OFF").

User Interaction: When a customer clicks on an offer card, the app should show the full details of the offer and a button to add it to their cart. This should function similarly to how a regular menu item works.

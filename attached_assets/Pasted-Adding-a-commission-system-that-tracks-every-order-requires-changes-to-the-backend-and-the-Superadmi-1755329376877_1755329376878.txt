Adding a commission system that tracks every order requires changes to the backend and the Superadmin dashboard. Here is a description for the Replit AI agent to implement this feature.

1. Backend Changes (API & Database)
The agent must create a new system to manage and track commissions for every single order.

Order Schema: Add new fields to the orders collection in MongoDB. These fields will be used to track the financial breakdown of each transaction and must be updated for every order:

orderCommissionRate: A percentage value representing the commission rate for the restaurant.

orderCommissionAmount: The calculated commission amount from the restaurant.

driverCommissionRate: A percentage value for the driver's commission.

driverCommissionAmount: The calculated commission amount from the driver.

platformProfit: The total profit for the platform from this single order (orderCommissionAmount+driverCommissionAmount).

Order Processing Endpoint: The agent must ensure that every time an order is completed, the API endpoint responsible for processing it runs a commission calculation. This calculation will use the pre-defined commission rates to determine the orderCommissionAmount and driverCommissionAmount. The final platformProfit will then be calculated and all of these values will be saved to the order's document in the database.

Commission Settings Endpoint: Create a secure endpoint, POST /admin/updateCommissionSettings, to allow the Superadmin to set and update the orderCommissionRate and driverCommissionRate that will be used in the calculation for all new orders.

2. Frontend Changes (Superadmin Dashboard)
The Superadmin dashboard will be the only place where this detailed financial data is visible.

New Secure Section: Create a new, dedicated page on the Superadmin dashboard called "Commissions & Financials." This page will be secured to ensure only a Superadmin can view it.

Real-time Data Display: This page will make an API call to a new secure endpoint, GET /admin/financials/commissions, which will query the orders collection. The data should be presented in a clear, easy-to-read format, such as a table or a series of charts, to show:

Total Commission Earned: The sum of platformProfit from all completed orders.

Individual Order Breakdown: A table listing each order, showing its ID, the calculated orderCommissionAmount, driverCommissionAmount, and platformProfit. This allows the Superadmin to track commission for every single order.

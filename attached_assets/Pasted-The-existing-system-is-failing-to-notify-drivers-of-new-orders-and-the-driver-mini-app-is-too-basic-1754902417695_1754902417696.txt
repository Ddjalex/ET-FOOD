The existing system is failing to notify drivers of new orders, and the driver mini-app is too basic for a professional delivery service. This requires a complete overhaul of the communication and app logic.

1. Fix the Core Notification Bug
First, the agent must fix the bug where the "Start Preparing" button doesn't trigger a notification. The entire data flow must be verified and debugged:

Action: Add extensive logging to the backend endpoint that handles the "Start Preparing" button click.

Log the order ID and the assigned driver's ID.

Log the exact payload that is being sent via WebSocket.

Log whether the WebSocket broadcast was successful.

Action: Add extensive logging to the driver mini-app's WebSocket listener.

Log all incoming messages to confirm they are being received.

Log any errors that occur when the app tries to process the incoming data.

This will pinpoint exactly where the communication is failing, allowing the agent to fix the issue.

2. Implement an Advanced, State-Based Driver App
Once the notification bug is resolved, the agent must transform the driver mini-app into a full-featured delivery management tool with the following features:

A. Dynamic UI Based on Order Status
The app's interface should change automatically as the order progresses.

Pending: A new, incoming order will appear on the screen as an interactive card. This card will contain "Accept" and "Reject" buttons.

Accepted: Once the driver accepts, the card will disappear and be replaced with a single, active trip screen. This screen will show the order details and the customer's live GPS location on an OpenStreetMap.

En Route to Restaurant: The active trip screen will display a prominent "Navigate to Restaurant" button.

Picked Up: After the driver clicks a "Picked Up" button (which replaces the "Navigate to Restaurant" button), the app will then show a "Navigate to Customer" button.

Delivered: Once the driver reaches the customer, they will click a "Delivered" button to complete the trip.

B. OpenStreetMap Integration with Navigation
The new app must use OpenStreetMap to show live locations and provide navigation.

Live Map: The active trip screen will have an embedded OpenStreetMap that shows the driver's current location relative to the restaurant and customer.

Navigation: When the driver clicks the "Navigate" button, the app will open the correct navigation route (to the restaurant, then to the customer) using the OpenStreetMap API.

This approach will create a professional, intuitive, and highly functional delivery system that is on par with the best delivery services in Ethiopia.
